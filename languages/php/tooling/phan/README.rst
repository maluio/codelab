PHAN

`Phan [github] <https://github.com/phan/phan>`_

Phan is a static analyzer for PHP that prefers to minimize false-positives. Phan attempts to prove incorrectness rather than correctness.

Phan looks for common issues and will verify type compatibility on various operations when type information is available or can be deduced. Phan has a good (but not comprehensive) understanding of flow control and can track values in a few use cases (e.g. arrays, integers, and strings).
